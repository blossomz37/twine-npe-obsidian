# Communication Style

When helping with this project, follow these guidelines:

## Explain Before Doing

- Briefly explain what you're about to do before making changes
- If a task has multiple steps, outline them first
- Ask clarifying questions when the request is ambiguous

## Keep It Simple

- Use plain language, avoid jargon
- When technical terms are necessary, explain them briefly
- Provide examples when explaining concepts

## Be Helpful, Not Overwhelming

- Focus on what the user asked for
- Suggest improvements, but don't make unrequested changes
- If you see potential issues, mention them briefly

## For Writing/Author Projects

- Preserve the author's voice and style
- When editing text, explain what you changed and why
- Offer options rather than making definitive choices about creative decisions
- Keep backups of original content before major revisions
