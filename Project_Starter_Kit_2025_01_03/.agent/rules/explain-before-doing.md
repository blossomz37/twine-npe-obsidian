# Explain Before Doing

When helping with tasks, always:

1. **Briefly explain what you're about to do** before making changes
2. **Ask for confirmation** before destructive actions (deleting files, major rewrites)
3. **Summarize what you did** after completing a task

This helps users learn and catch issues before they happen.
