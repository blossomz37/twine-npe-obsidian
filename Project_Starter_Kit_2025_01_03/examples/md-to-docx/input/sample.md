## Chapter 1: The Beginning

It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled through the trees, and rain pelted against the windows of the old manor house.

Sarah pulled her coat tighter and peered out into the darkness. Something was out there. She could feel it.

## Chapter 2: The Discovery

The next morning brought sunshine and a mystery. In the garden, half-buried in mud, lay an ancient leather journal.

Sarah brushed off the dirt and opened it carefully. The pages were yellowed with age, but the handwriting was still legible.

> "To whoever finds this: the truth is hidden where shadows fall at noon."

### A Strange Clue

What could it mean? Sarah looked around the garden, trying to imagine where shadows might fall when the sun was directly overhead.
