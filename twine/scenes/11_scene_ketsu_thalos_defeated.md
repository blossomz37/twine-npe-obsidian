## Summary
Thalos is defeated—not by violence alone, but by the bond between Kai and Freddy. The Shell blazes with combined power. Thalos retreats into the deep, wounded and humbled. The sanctuary is saved. Kai collapses, exhausted, and Freddy catches him.

## Key Events
- The Shell's light intensifies—responds to love, not just guardian power
- Thalos feels it: the bond he dismissed is stronger than him
- His voice, smaller: "This isn't over, little guardian."
- Thalos sinks into the depths, retreating
- Kai's transformation recedes; he falls into Freddy's arms
- First words after: "You stayed." "Of course I stayed."
