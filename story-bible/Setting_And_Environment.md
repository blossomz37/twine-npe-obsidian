# Setting & Environment

## 🏞 Primary Location(s)  

- **Name:** Starlight Cove  

- **Type / Scale:** Small seaside town + hidden tide-pool grotto (rocky coastal bay)  

- **Overview Description:**  

  A quiet seaside settlement perched on craggy rocks and gentle waves, Starlight Cove invites late-night wanderers and tide-pool seekers. Below the boardwalk and café lights, a hidden grotto pulses with moon-lit magic—where sea meets shadow, and monsters meet hearts.  

- **Key Characteristics:**  

  - **Geography & Landscape:** Rocky outcrops, tide-pool basins carved into basalt, sea-cave entrance, boardwalk following the cliff edge, salt-worn windows overlooking water.  

  - **Water / Tide / Sea influences:** The tide is a character: two tides in ~25 hours; moon-drift (peak tide under full moon) amplifies magic.  [oai_citation:0‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

  - **Architecture / Built Environment:** The late-night diner with large glass windows facing the sea, string-lights along the boardwalk, outdoor benches at tide-pool edge, weather-worn signs, lanterns that flicker with sea-breeze.  

- **Sensory Details:**  

  - **Sounds:** The steady hiss of wave-spray, distant diner chatter, the soft thump of tide-pool water into rock basins, the whisper of the wind through kelp.  

  - **Smells:** Roasting coffee, sea-salt mist, drift-wood smoke, warm dough of late-night pastries.  

  - **Textures:** Smooth tide-pool pebbles underfoot, rough basalt rock walls, warm amber glow of diner lights, cool bioluminescent glow against skin.  

  - **Visual cues (lighting, colour palette):** Moonlight silver on sea-spray, deep teal navy of night-water, amber diner interior, bioluminescent green-blue glow of monster arms underneath.  

- **Role in Story:**  

  The setting becomes more than backdrop—it’s a threshold between human and monster worlds. The diner is safe-space for Elliot; the tide-pool grotto is Kai’s realm. Their relationship unfolds where those spaces overlap.

## 🌊 Secondary / Supporting Locations  

- **Name & Description #1:** Boardwalk Rock-Outcrop  

  - **Significance:** The place where Elliot first glimpses the monster’s silhouette; where human and monster worlds meet visually.  

  - **Key Scenes:** First visual encounter; moon-walk conversation; erosion/footprint discovery.  

- **Name & Description #2:** Sea-Cave Stairway  

  - **Significance:** Hidden entrance to the grotto under tide-pool; accessed at low tide.  

  - **Key Scenes:** Elliot follows; Kai retreats; threat approaches via cave mouth; intimate moments near dripping walls.

## 🧬 Ecology & Creature Environment  

- **Local Flora & Fauna:**  

  Rocky intertidal zone filled with mussels, barnacles, sea-stars, sea-weed fronds—creatures whose survival depends on changing tides.  [oai_citation:1‡National Ocean Service](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tide-pool.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

- **Monster/Creature Habitats & Movement:**  

  Kai’s sea-form inhabits the tide-pool grotto beneath the boardwalk; at moon-drift he emerges, gliding from rock basin to boardwalk edge; in human form he lingers near sea-glass windows of diner, arms folded like sea-kelp.  

- **Lunar / Tide / Seasonal Cycles:**  

  - **Moon Phases & Effect on Creatures:** Full moon → moon-drift → guardian power peak; New moon → quiet seas, monster rests.  

  - **Tide Cycles & Significance:** Tide-pool access only at lowest tide for human/monster encounters; high tide floods grotto, hides secret world.  [oai_citation:2‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

  - **Seasonal Changes & Impact on Community:** Late summer nights warm, open-air boardwalk; autumn storms bring higher tides, more risk of sanctuary breach; winter calmer but isolation stronger.  

- **Natural Threats / Environmental Hazards:**  

  Sudden rise of tide cutting off sea-cave stairway; wave surges damaging diner glass; slippery algae-covered rocks; predator arms reaching under water (metaphor and literal threat).

## 🎭 Town / Region Culture & Community  

- **Name of Town / Region:** Starlight Cove  

- **Population & Demographics:** Small community (approx 4,000 residents) of locals, late-night shift workers, tide-pool enthusiasts, occasional tourists.  

- **Economy & Key Industry:**  

  Late-night diner culture; tide-pool viewing tours; moon-walk boardwalk strolling; local artisanal sea-salt goods.  

- **Local Traditions / Festivals / Mythology:**  

  Monthly “Moon-Tide Gathering” on full moon: townsfolk stroll boardwalk after midnight, wave-lit café specials, tide-pool lanterns, legend-telling of “arms in the water.”  

- **Community Layout & Landmarks:**  

  - **Landmark 1:** Starlight Cove Diner – landmark of warm light in darkness.  

  - **Landmark 2:** Tide-Pool Grotto entrance – hidden stairway under boardwalk, unmarked by majority.  

- **Relationship between town and monsters/creatures:**  

  Town has myth-whisper of sea-guardian but mostly treats it as legend; few locals know cave stories; human MC’s diner is gateway between townsfolk and hidden sea-world.

## 📆 Temporal & Environmental Variables  

- **Climate / Weather Patterns:**  

  Mild maritime climate; late-night sea breeze cool; autumn storms bring heavy surf; fog rolling off ocean in spring; salt-laden air rusting metal and wood.  

- **Time of Day / Lighting Conditions:**  

  Evening and late-night key: diner shift 10 pm–3 am; moon-drift hours around 1–2 am. Dawn’s hush when tide-pool empty, secret world rests.  

- **Tide & Lunar Mechanics:**  

  - Lowest tide gives access to grotto; highest tide hides it.  

  - Moon-drift is the peak of monster power and risk.  

- **Historical Environmental Changes / Events:**  

  Previous storms broke sections of boardwalk; sea-cave roof collapsed decades ago; the “Breach at Moon-Rise” left part of tide-pool grotto partially sealed—monster heritage trace.  

## 🗺 Map & Spatial Relations  

- **Map Sketch or Diagram:** (to include visual)  

- **Key Spatial Relationships:**  

  - Diner is 200 ft from tide-pool edge; boardwalk runs parallel to cliff 150 ft above sea-level; sea-cave stairway descends 50 ft beneath boardwalk.  

- **Movement / Travel Paths:**  

  - Elliot walks from diner back-door across boardwalk to tide-pool bench; Kai swims from grotto into tide-pool, climbs hidden steps to boardwalk edge; predator threat enters via surf cave entrance at high tide.
