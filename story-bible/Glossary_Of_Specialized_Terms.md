## Glossary of Specialized Terms

**Cove-heart**

- *Definition & Notes:* The central tide-pool grotto beneath the boardwalk rock out-crop in Starlight Cove. The place where the sea guardian (Kai) emerges and the sacred artifact lies hidden.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Use when describing the hidden grotto; a focal point for monster/human encounters and stakes.

**Moon-drift**

- *Definition & Notes:* The hour after full moon when the tides are highest and the sea-creature guardian’s powers are strongest.

- *Usage/Story Link:* A timing cue in story beats: this is when Kai shifts form/guardian role peaks.

**Fade-wave**

- *Definition & Notes:* A phenomenon when the tide-pool’s bioluminescent glow dims—a sign of disruption to the artifact or guardian’s power.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Use as warning/or omen in the plot when external threat looms.

**Tide-Guard Brood**

- *Definition & Notes:* The ancient aggregation/heritage line of sea-creature guardians who once gathered at the grotto to protect the artifact.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Back-story anchor: Kai is one of the last survivors of this line.

**Spire-crest**

- *Definition & Notes:* A shell-like ridge or fin-crest on the guardian’s back (sea-form) visible in moonlit tide-pool water.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Creature detail: use to describe Kai’s sea-creature anatomy, helping human MC recognise “his monster”.

**Sucker-glow**

- *Definition & Notes:* Bioluminescent rings or spots along the arms/suckers of the guardian’s sea-form arms; glow intensifies under moonlight.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Visual cue: when Kai’s protective mode activates or when he helps Freddy, his arms glow subtly.

**Mantle crest**

- *Definition & Notes:* The muscular mantle structure housing the guardian’s vital organs and signalling transformation. Adapted from cephalopod anatomy (mantle).

- *Usage/Story Link:* Used when describing transformation from sea-creature to humanoid form of Kai.

**Arms (vs tentacles)**

- *Definition & Notes:* In cephalopod anatomy a key distinction: octopuses have arms (with suckers along full length), tentacles differ.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Use consistent term “arms” when describing Kai’s appendages; avoids mis-labeling with “tentacles”.

**Appendage-reach**

- *Definition & Notes:* A poetic term for the guardian’s arms when they emerge from the tide-pool to touch the human world; reaching across boundary.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Emotional/romantic metaphor: Kai’s “appendage-reach” for Freddy symbolizes crossing the divide.

**Tide-pool grotto**

- *Definition & Notes:* The sub-surfaced cave & rock-basin where sea-water pools at low tide and the guardian resides; part of Starlight Cove geography.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Location anchor: use when describing setting, scenes of mystery and bond development.

**Late-night diner shift**

- *Definition & Notes:* The temporal concept for human MC’s regular schedule—hours when town is quiet, tide is low, monster world comes closer.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Setting/time anchor: this is where human and monster worlds intersect.

**Sea-artifact / Lunar Shell of Tide-Light**

- *Definition & Notes:* The sacred object buried beneath the tide-pool grotto, once maintained by the Tide-Guard Brood, stabilising the cove’s tides and glow.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Plot anchor: threat revolves around this object; monster/human bond tied to protecting it.

**Boardwalk rock-outcrop**

- *Definition & Notes:* The vantage point above the tide-pool where the human MC often watches the sea and first glimpses the monster.

- *Usage/Story Link:* Setting detail: Use to stage first encounter, intimate walks, tide-pool view.

## Checklist / Task Items for Glossary

- [ ] Review each term and link to story-bible pages (Setting, Creature Lore, Characters)

- [ ] Add pronunciation notes if needed for any term (especially unique ones)

- [ ] Ensure usage consistency across the manuscript (e.g., always “arms”, not “tentacles”)

- [ ] Expand glossary as story develops (e.g., if you add new monster types, community terms)

- [ ] Cross-reference glossary terms in metadata/tags if helpful (for discoverability)
