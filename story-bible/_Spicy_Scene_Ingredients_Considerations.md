🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Profile Add-Ons for MCs (so you can plug them in to the character bios)

Use the following fields in the MC profiles to prepare for spicy scenes:

For Mark Gray (Human MC)

    •	Sensual Trigger Points / Pleasure Spots: (e.g., the warmth of a diner lamp on his skin, the brush of sea-salt mist on his neck, the light of bioluminescent arms on his back)

    •	Physical + Emotional Reaction to Monster’s Body: (e.g., when Kai’s arms glow, Mark feels a soft electrical thrill down his spine; when Kai’s “mantle crest” shifts in sea-form, Mark’s breath catches)

    •	Comfort Zone vs. Edge: Mark is comfortable in human world (warm diner, familiar smells) but edge is when monster world invades his safe space (arms reaching from water, bioluminescent glow).

    •	Intimacy Goal: Mark wants to feel safe, seen, cherished — so his spicy scenes should reflect his letting go of control and accepting otherness.

    •	Monster Sensory Contrast: What in Kai’s body is new/different to Mark? (cool-wet skin, subtle suckers, bioluminescent trace, strong arms, sea-salt taste).

For Kai (Monster MC)

    •	Intimate Body Details in Both Forms: (human form: faint “sucker glow” along arms under moonlight; sea form: arms ripple, mantle crest arches, bioluminescent arcs between suckers)

    •	Emotional Barrier to Physicality: Kai is guardian, used to duty not love; letting sentiment and sensation in is scary.

    •	Touch Language: His arms (monster) can “wrap” differently — maybe arms feel stronger, more enveloping, but need to be gentle to suit the human.

    •	Transformation Sensation in Intimacy: The change from sea-form to human form (or vice versa) during intimate moments can heighten novelty (moon-drift timing) — this gives you unique monster/human physical stakes.

    •	Intimacy Goal: Accept that he desires rather than simply protects; show vulnerability in letting the human in.

📋 Template Add-On Fields for Both Characters

Add these fields into your Character section so spicy scenes are baked into their arcs:

    •	Heat-Level Comfort Zone: (e.g., Mark = comfortable with moderate heat; Kai = cautious about physical intimacy but curious)

    •	Monster/Human Physical Novelty to Explore: (list 3-5 unique touches e.g., “bioluminescent arms,” “mantle crest under moon,” “sea-salt taste on skin,” “appendage-reach across tide-pool”)

    •	Emotional/Physical Trigger for First Time: (What specific scene or moment leads them to let go—for example: Mark alone at late-night shift, sees Kai emerge in moonlight and feels pull; Kai realises his arms glow when Mark touches his shoulder…)

    •	Intimacy Milestones:

    •	Milestone 1: First physical touch beyond accidental (Level 1).

    •	Milestone 2: First kiss + awareness of monster body (Level 2).

    •	Milestone 3: Full intimate scene with monster/human novelty (Level 3).

    •	Intimacy Barriers to Overcome: (E.g., fear of exposure, fear of harming human, feeling “too monster,” human fear of otherness)

    •	Aftercare / Emotional Closure: (Important in monster/human romance especially; after a Level 3 scene they need moment of safe affirmation, monster hugging human, human reassuring monster)

🎯 Example Snippets to Work Into The Profile

    •	Mark’s detail: “He’s never felt another’s arms feel so vast and warm — and the faint glow of Kai’s hands against his skin sends a shiver through him he can’t name.”

    •	Kai’s detail: “When Kai’s mantle crest dips under moon-drift, Mark’s fingertips trace its ridge, and for a moment Kai forgets the tide-pool’s duty and only feels the human’s breath.”

    •	Heat milestone note: “Chapter 12 – Level 3: Moonlit tide-pool grotto scene. Bioluminescent arms, sea-salt taste, human and guardian release tension together; afterwards the waves hush and Mark falls asleep wrapped in Kai’s arms.”

✅ How to Use This

    •	Add the spicy-scene fields into your Character profiles now — that way you keep track of what touches feel novel, what triggers the intimacy, and how monster/human body differences create heat and texture.

    •	In your chapter beat sheets, mark Intimacy Level and reference the milestone fields above so you know which scene is hitting Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.

    •	In your world-building, ensure you have the sensory details (sea-salt, tide-pool glow, bioluminescent arms) ready so you can weave them into the physical/sexual scenes.

    •	Ensure your erotic scenes still advance relationship, emotional stakes, and character arcs (not just physical). As one craft article notes: “love scenes aren’t just about the choreography … you need to make sure all the various body parts are where they are supposed to be… but before you get there, you need to make sure the deeper elements of the love scene are addressed.”  ￼
