# Writing Style

### **Tone & Style Guidelines:**

1. **Narrative Voice:**

   * Use **third-person limited** or **close third-person** for deep emotional connection with the protagonist.

   * The voice should be **confident and clear**, balanced with moments of vulnerability and introspection. The protagonist should reflect on both internal emotions and external circumstances.

2. **Character Dynamics:**

   * Relationships should be **emotionally complex**, with tension and organic romantic development. Intimate moments—whether through dialogue or shared silences—should feel natural.

   * Dialogue should be **realistic yet heightened**, conveying subtext and emotion without excessive exposition. Characters often express more through silence or small gestures than direct statements.

3. **Emotional Resonance:**

   * Prose should be **emotionally charged but not melodramatic**. Small gestures (e.g., a lingering touch, a shared glance, a quiet sigh) should convey deep emotions.

   * **Internal monologues** should explore self-doubt, identity, and growth, leading characters to emerge stronger by the end of a scene.

4. **Pacing & Build-Up:**

   * Tension should build gradually to **soft emotional climaxes**. Let key moments breathe—don’t rush through emotional beats.

   * **Seamless transitions** should reflect how emotions influence actions, and vice versa.

5. **Subtle Repetition for Emotional Impact:**

   * Repeat key phrases or words purposefully at emotional climaxes to highlight the protagonist’s evolving mindset.

6. **Setting & Atmosphere:**

   * Settings should mirror characters’ emotional states and be described **symbolically** (e.g., a turbulent sky reflecting inner turmoil).

   * The environment should never feel incidental but instead enhance the mood and tension of the scene.

7. **Romantic Tension & Connection:**

   * Build **romantic tension gradually**, using subtle physical contact (e.g., a hand brushing against an arm, a lingering gaze) instead of overt descriptions.

   * Romance should feel **inevitable yet fragile**, with characters reflecting on emotional risks but moving forward regardless.

8. **Character Growth & Resolution:**

   * Characters should **evolve meaningfully** through small but significant changes in dialogue, actions, and thoughts.

   * Endings should feel **earned and emotionally complex**, leaving readers satisfied yet acknowledging life’s imperfections.

### **Scene Planning & Writing:**

1. Sentences should be at least **7 words long**; paragraphs should have a **minimum of 5 sentences**.

2. Use precise, evocative language to **broaden vocabulary** and create a distinct world.

3. Incorporate **cadence through conjunctions and clauses**.

4. Ensure **physical interactions** between characters and their surroundings.

5. Scenes should include **objects or other people** to create a fully realized setting.

6. Use **reflective downbeats** to help characters decide their next actions.

7. Weave in **metaphors, similes, or foreshadowing** to enrich the prose.

8. Take time to **build immersive prose** without slipping into purple prose.

9. Ensure the story has **re-read value**, adding **hidden details or “easter eggs.”**

### **Chapters & Scene Openings/Closings:**

1. **Start chapters in the middle of an action, conversation, or conflict.** Avoid openings with arrivals, waking up, or weather descriptions. Instead, use sensory details, dialogue, or an incomplete situation that demands explanation.

2. **End chapters with tension or subtext.** Use a mix of sentence lengths for natural rhythm, avoiding abrupt endings or excessive reflection. Focus on unresolved actions rather than physical departures.

### **Consistent Immersion:**

1. Keep readers **emotionally invested** from beginning to end. Each chapter should feel like an **episode of a gripping TV series**, drawing them deeper into the narrative.

2. Avoid direct references to real-world locations or brands. Instead, describe settings **vaguely yet evocatively** (e.g., “a neon-lit metropolis” instead of “Tokyo”).

3. Subtle **foreboding** should run through key moments, evoking tension and anticipation without overt exposition.

### **Deep Character Development:**

1. Reveal characters’ **personalities, emotions, and growth** through action, dialogue, and thought, rather than direct exposition.

2. Ensure that **settings reflect characters’ emotional states**, reinforcing themes and internal struggles.

3. Use **subtle cues** (e.g., a character brushing off snow while entering a tavern) instead of outright stating environmental details.

### **Engaging Dialogue:**

1. Dialogue should feel **natural yet purposeful**, advancing the plot and deepening relationships.

2. Avoid overuse of character names; instead, let dynamics emerge through tone and interaction.

### **Balanced Pacing & Tension:**

1. Maintain a **dynamic rhythm**, alternating between tension, action, and introspection.

2. Subtle tension should persist even in quieter moments.

### **Evolving Relationships:**

1. Allow character relationships to **develop naturally**, using subtext and layered dialogue to hint at deeper emotions or conflicts.

2. Ensure every interaction **builds upon the last**, making the emotional stakes feel real.

### **Emotional Resonance:**

1. Place characters in situations that **challenge them emotionally**, revealing both strengths and vulnerabilities.

2. Use **setting and tone** to amplify emotional stakes, creating an immersive, visceral experience.

### **Subtle Use of Time of Day:**

1. Avoid direct time references via celestial elements (e.g., “The sun rose over the city”). Instead, let **actions imply time** (e.g., “She rushed to finish before dinner”).

### **Tone & Style:**

1. **Subtle but Foreboding:**

   * Create **quiet tension**, where implications and mood hint at deeper currents rather than outright stating them.

   * Avoid overt descriptions of danger—let unease build through **character perception** and environmental cues.

2. **Character-Centric Narrative:**

   * Keep descriptions **rooted in the protagonist’s experiences**, allowing the setting to reflect their inner world.

3. **Fluid, Immersive Writing:**

   * Language should flow naturally, without convoluted phrasing that disrupts immersion.

4. **Meaningful Word Choice:**

   * Select words with intentional connotations to enhance subtext. Avoid real-world references unless fictionalized.

   * Use **sensory details subtly** to enhance the setting without overburdening the prose.

### **Writing Intimate or Explicit Scenes:**

1. If the scene becomes explicit, use **[EXPLICIT][/EXPLICIT]** and continue with character emotions and relationship development.

2. Focus on **emotional responses rather than graphic descriptions**, ensuring scenes feel earned and character-driven.
