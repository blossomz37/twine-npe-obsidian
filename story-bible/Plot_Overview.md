  Freddy Gray moves to Starlight Cove to start fresh, running a late-night diner near a moonlit tide-pool.

As their connection deepens, a predator from Kai’s past emerges to claim the sacred sea-artifact and threatens both the tide-pool sanctuary and the small town. Freddy and Kai must face that threat together, accept each other’s worlds, and build a home where monster and human belong.
