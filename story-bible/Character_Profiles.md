🦹 Antagonist – Thalos

    •	Role in story: Predator-kraken hybrid, antagonist from Kai’s past who threatens the sanctuary and the human/monster relationship.

    •	External Conflict(s): He invades the sanctuary region, threatens town/diner indirectly, draws Kai out.

    •	Internal Conflict(s): Underestimates the human/monster emotional bond; his own old wounds drive cruelty.

    •	Start: Confident predator, sure of victory.

    •	Change: Learns that power alone doesn’t hold sanctuaries when people/monsters stand together.

    •	End: Either defeated/withdrawn or forced to reconsider in future book—giving room for series continuity.

    •	Relation to MCs / other characters:

    •	To Kai – former fellow guardian turned enemy; embodies past Kai can’t undo.

    •	To Elliot – threat to everything Elliot trusts in: diner, town, monster-lover.

    •	Additional Notes:

    •	His threat must feel real but not catastrophic horror—fits cozy monster romance: tension-filled, not gore.
