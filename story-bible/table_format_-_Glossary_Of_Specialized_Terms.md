| Term | Definition & Notes | Usage/Story Link |

|------|--------------------|------------------|

| **Cove-heart** | The central tide-pool grotto beneath the boardwalk rock out-crop in Starlight Cove. The place where the sea guardian (Kai) emerges and the sacred artifact lies hidden. | Use when describing the hidden grotto; a focal point for monster/human encounters and stakes. |

| **Moon-drift** | The hour after full moon when the tides are highest and the sea-creature guardian’s powers are strongest. | A timing cue in story beats: this is when Kai shifts form/guardian role peaks. |

| **Fade-wave** | A phenomenon when the tide-pool’s bioluminescent glow dims—a sign of disruption to the artifact or guardian’s power. | Use as warning/or omen in the plot when external threat looms. |

| **Tide-Guard Brood** | The ancient aggregation/heritage line of sea-creature guardians who once gathered at the grotto to protect the artifact. | Back-story anchor: Kai is one of the last survivors of this line. |

| **Spire-crest** | A shell-like ridge or fin-crest on the guardian’s back (sea-form) visible in moonlit tide-pool water. | Creature detail: use to describe Kai’s sea-creature anatomy, helping human MC recognise “his monster”. |

| **Sucker-glow** | Bioluminescent rings or spots along the arms/suckers of the guardian’s sea-form arms; glow intensifies under moonlight. | Visual cue: when Kai’s protective mode activates or when he helps Freddy, his arms glow subtly. |

| **Mantle crest** | The muscular mantle structure housing the guardian’s vital organs and signalling transformation. Adapted from cephalopod anatomy (mantle) [oai_citation:0‡HowStuffWorks](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/marine-life/octopus1.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Used when describing transformation from sea-creature to humanoid form of Kai. |

| **Arms (vs tentacles)** | In cephalopod anatomy a key distinction: octopuses have arms (with suckers along full length), tentacles differ. [oai_citation:1‡SCDNR](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/sertc/Featured%20Species%20O%20vulgaris.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Use consistent term “arms” when describing Kai’s appendages; avoids mis-labeling with “tentacles”. |

| **Appendage-reach** | A poetic term for the guardian’s arms when they emerge from the tide-pool to touch the human world; reaching across boundary. | Emotional/romantic metaphor: Kai’s “appendage-reach” for Freddy symbolizes crossing the divide. |

| **Tide-pool grotto** | The sub-surfaced cave & rock-basin where sea-water pools at low tide and the guardian resides; part of Starlight Cove geography. [oai_citation:2‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Location anchor: use when describing setting, scenes of mystery and bond development. |

| **Late-night diner shift** | The temporal concept for human MC’s regular schedule—hours when town is quiet, tide is low, monster world comes closer. | Setting/time anchor: this is where human and monster worlds intersect. |

| **Sea-artifact / Lunar Shell of Tide-Light** | The sacred object buried beneath the tide-pool grotto, once maintained by the Tide-Guard Brood, stabilising the cove’s tides and glow. | Plot anchor: threat revolves around this object; monster/human bond tied to protecting it. |

| **Boardwalk rock-outcrop** | The vantage point above the tide-pool where the human MC often watches the sea and first glimpses the monster. | Setting detail: Use to stage first encounter, intimate walks, tide-pool view. |

## ✅ Checklist / Task Items for Glossary

- [ ] Review each term and link to story-bible pages (Setting, Creature Lore, Characters)

- [ ] Add pronunciation notes if needed for any term (especially unique ones)

- [ ] Ensure usage consistency across the manuscript (e.g., always “arms”, not “tentacles”)

- [ ] Expand glossary as story develops (e.g., if you add new monster types, community terms)

- [ ] Cross-reference glossary terms in metadata/tags if helpful (for discoverability)
