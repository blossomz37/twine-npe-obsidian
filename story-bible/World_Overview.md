# World Overview

## 🌍 Setting Summary  

- **Name of the Place/World:** Starlight Cove  

- **Location & Scope:** A quiet seaside town on a sheltered coastal bay, fractured rock shoreline with tide-pools, boardwalk diner district, sea-cave access along the cliffs.  

- **Brief Description:**  

  Nestled between kelp-swept rocks and a moon-lit tide-pool grotto, Starlight Cove is where the ordinary meets the extraordinary. Coffee aromas drift alongside sea-salt breezes, and hidden beneath the waves lies a guardian older than the waves themselves.  

- **Tone & Genre Conventions:**  

  Cozy MM monster romance meets seaside myth. Supernatural elements are present but embedded softly into the community. The monster is protector, not predator (for the most part). Romance and belonging are at the heart.  

- **Key Themes & Motifs:**  

  - Theme 1: Belonging and Found Home  

  - Theme 2: Otherness and Acceptance  

  - Motif: Moon-reflected tide-pools, diner light blending with sea-glow, arms/appendages reaching from water as both threat & salvation  

## 🧬 Vocabulary & Creature Ecology  

- **Creature Lineage / Monster Heritage Name:** Tide-Guard Brood (the original aggregation/heritage)  

- **Behavioural Ecology / Community Structure:**  

  - The Tide-Guard guardians originally gathered in an aggregation around the hidden grotto to renew the sea-artifact’s power every tenth moon.  

  - After a predator’s assault, only a few survivors remained. Now the guardian (Kai) lives solitary, watching the tide-pool.  

- **Anatomical Terms & Conventions:**  

  - Appendages: “arms” (not tentacles) when human-form; “mantle crest” in sea-form; bioluminescent “sucker-glow” along arms.  

  - Transformation: Under full-moon tide-rise Kai shifts from largely sea-creature form to a humanoid guardian form (dual arms + partial mantle visible).  

  - “Spire-crest” refers to a shell-like ridge on the guardian’s back in sea form.  

- **Specialised Vocabulary:**  

  - *Cove-heart* – the central tide-pool grotto beneath the boardwalk rock out-crop.  

  - *Moon-drift* – the hour after full moon when tides peak and guardian power is strongest.  

  - *Fade-wave* – when the tide-pool water loses its glow, a sign of guardian weakening or external disturbance.  

- **Back-story of Creature Community/Aggregation:**  

  The Tide-Guard Brood built their legacy around protecting the cove’s artifact and maintaining balance between sea creatures and shore-town. That changed when the predator from Kai’s past attacked, breaking the aggregation and forcing exile.

## 📜 Historical Back-Story Snapshot  

- **Major Past Event(s):**  

  - The *Breach at Moon-Rise*: On the tenth moon of the century, the predator (Thalos) attacked the Tide-Guard Brood in the grotto. The artifact was almost taken, the brood decimated, survivors scattered.  

- **How the Past Shapes the Present:**  

  - Kai carries guilt and fear of exposure.  

  - The cove’s tide-glow has fluctuated intermittently ever since—locals sense something mysterious but unresolved.  

  - The community’s late-night diner culture grew partly because of the moonlit sea-traffic—tourists, night-walkers, contemplation seekers.  

- **Key Artifact or Sacred Object:**  

  - Name: The Lunar Shell of Tide-Light  

  - Purpose / Power: Keeps the tide-pool’s glow and stabilises the sea-shore barrier; a symbol of guardian duty.  

  - Location: Hidden in the grotto beneath the boardwalk rock formation at Starlight Cove.  

  - Connection to Creature Lineage: Only the Tide-Guard Brood could renew it every tenth moon; without it the guardian’s power fades.  

- **Present Status:**  

  - Artifact still in place, but weakened. Kai watches it alone. The predator threatens to return. The town is unaware of full details but senses change (fade-wave events, strange lights).  

## 🏙 Town / Region Details (if applicable)  

- **Name of Town / Region:** Starlight Cove  

- **Environment & Geography:**  

  - Rocky shoreline carved into tide-pools, a boardwalk and late-night diner district perched above the tide-pool grotto.  

  - Sea-cave access along cliff face leads down to the grotto beneath the tide-pool.  

  - Moonlight filters through gaps in cliff, illuminating arms of sea-creature glimpsed in tide-pool water.  

- **Climate / Seasonal / Lunar Cycles:**  

  - Tidal behaviour: Two tides each ~25 hours; lowest tide provides best access to the grotto/guardian’s emergence.  [oai_citation:0‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

  - Seasons: Late summer nights are warm and busy; autumn storms bring stronger tides and challenge for monster guardian.  

  - Lunar phases matter deeply: Full moon = monster shifts, artefact recharge, higher energy; New moon = calm, fading glow.  

- **Community & Culture Highlights:**  

  - Late-night diner (Starlight Cove Diner) is local hub for residents and visitors watching tide-pool at night.  

  - Monthly “Moon-Tide Gathering” (local informal event) where townsfolk stroll the boardwalk by full moon, cafés open till late, tide-pool viewing permitted.  

  - Sea-legend tours: A local elder tells story of “sea-arms in the moon-water” to children and visitors.  

- **Key Locations:**  

  - **Location 1:** Starlight Cove Diner – late-night café with large windows facing tide-pool; warm inside vs cool sea-air outside.  

  - **Location 2:** Tide-Pool Grotto (“Cove-heart”) – hidden beneath boardwalk rock, accessible by sea-cave stairs at low tide; moon-lit water, reflective surface, bioluminescent glow.  

  - **Location 3:** Boardwalk & Rock-Outcrop – promenade overlooking tide-pools; vantage for both monster and human interactions; place for first encounter.
