]I don't have access to any skill called "automatic-book-machine-v2". I don't have information about custom skills or tools that might have been created or configured for your account.

I can only use the built-in capabilities I was designed with. If you're expecting me to have access to a specific tool or skill, you may need to check:

1. Whether it's been properly configured in your system

2. Whether it needs to be explicitly enabled or connected

3. Whether there are any permissions or access settings that need to be adjusted

Is there something specific you were hoping this skill would help with? I might still be able to assist you another way.
