# Chapter 1: "Late-Night Shift"

The last coffee cup clinks onto the tray just as the boardwalk lights flicker and the tide-pool outside the window shivers green-blue.

I pause, dishrag in hand, and watch the water through the salt-streaked glass. The glow pulses once—twice—then settles back into its usual shimmer, the kind tourists assume is just bioluminescent plankton catching the moon. I know better now. Or at least, I'm starting to suspect there's more to it than marine biology can explain.

"Elliot, you gonna stand there all night staring at seaweed, or you gonna help me lock up?"

Marcus's voice pulls me back to the warm amber interior of the Starlight Cove Diner. My diner. The thought still feels strange, even three months in—like borrowed clothing I haven't quite grown into yet.

"Sorry." I turn from the window, the dishrag leaving a damp trail across the counter as I wipe down the last section. "Just thought I saw something."

"Yeah, you and every other tide-pool romantic in this town." Marcus grins as he shoulders into his jacket, a beat-up leather thing with a wave-crest patch sewn onto the sleeve. His spiky blond hair catches the overhead lights as he tilts his head toward the door. "Sea does weird things at night. You get used to it."

Do you, though? I want to ask. But Marcus has already moved on, counting out the till with practiced efficiency while humming something off-key. He's been working the late shift with me since I opened—the only applicant who didn't blink twice at the hours. Ten PM to three AM, five nights a week, catering to insomniacs, third-shifters, and the occasional wanderer who finds themselves drawn to our little corner of the cove when the rest of the world sleeps.

I finish wiping down the counter and dump the rag in the wash bin. The clock above the register reads 11:47 PM. Tuesday night—our slowest. The last customer left an hour ago, a woman with sea-glass eyes who nursed a chamomile tea and sketched the tide-pool in a worn notebook. She comes in sometimes, never says much. Just draws and drinks and leaves exact change on the table.

"You good to finish up?" Marcus asks, shrugging his messenger bag over his shoulder. "Jenny's expecting me."

"Yeah, go." I wave him off. "I've got it."

He pauses at the door, one hand on the frame. The night breeze slips in around him, carrying the sharp bite of salt and kelp. "Don't stay out on that boardwalk too long. Breeze bites tonight."

"I won't."

But we both know I will. I always do.

The door swings shut behind him with a soft chime, and suddenly the diner feels bigger. Emptier. The hum of the refrigerator fills the space where conversation used to be, and the overhead lights cast long shadows across the checkered floor. I move through the closing routine on autopilot—checking the coffee machines, covering the pastries, switching off the back burners in the kitchen.

My hands know the rhythm now. Wipe, rinse, store. Lock, check, confirm. It's meditative, this late-night ritual. Back in the city, I used to dread the end of the workday—the commute home to an empty apartment, the blue glow of a laptop screen waiting for me with another round of revisions, another set of impossible deadlines. Graphic design paid the bills, but it hollowed me out one pixel at a time until I woke up one morning and couldn't remember why I'd wanted it in the first place.

The breakdown came quietly. No dramatic collapse, no hospital stay. Just me, sitting at my desk at 2 AM, staring at a logo that wouldn't cooperate, and realizing I couldn't do it anymore. Not one more day. Not one more file.

So I left.

Sold what little I had, took the money my grandmother left me, and bought a one-way ticket to anywhere that wasn't there. Starlight Cove wasn't even on my radar until I saw the listing—a failing diner with a view of the water, owner desperate to retire. The photos showed worn booths and outdated equipment, but also those huge windows looking out over the tide-pools, and something in my chest said *yes*.

I haven't regretted it. Not really. But there are nights—quiet ones like this—when I wonder if I'm building something real or just passing through in slow motion.

I flip off the main lights, leaving only the strand of Edison bulbs Marcus strung along the front windows. They cast a softer glow, warmer, the kind that makes the diner look like a postcard. Outside, the boardwalk stretches along the cliff edge, wooden planks worn smooth by decades of footsteps and sea spray. A few benches dot the railing, and beyond them, the tide-pools glitter in the moonlight.

The water is quieter tonight. The tide's on its way out—I've learned to read it now, the way the locals do. Low tide means the pools are accessible, the rock basins exposed, the hidden world of mussels and barnacles and starfish laid bare under the moon. Sometimes I'll see couples walking the boardwalk at this hour, leaning over the railing to peer into the pools. Sometimes it's just me.

I grab my towel from the hook by the back door—an old habit from the days when I thought I'd have time to go for runs along the shore—and step outside.

The air hits me immediately, cool and damp, carrying the perpetual whisper of waves against rock. I breathe it in, let it fill my lungs, feel the tension in my shoulders start to ease. This is why I came here. This exact moment. The hush of the sea, the silver path of moonlight on the water, the sense that the world has finally slowed down enough for me to catch up.

I walk to the edge of the boardwalk, where the railing overlooks the largest of the tide-pools. It's maybe twenty feet across, bordered by jagged basalt formations that look like they've been here since the dawn of time. During the day, tourists cluster here with their phones and their kids, pointing at sea stars and anemones. But at night, it's different.

At night, it glows.

Not much—just a faint shimmer beneath the surface, like someone spilled liquid moonlight into the water. I used to think it was algae or plankton, something scientific and explainable. But the glow doesn't behave like that. It pulses. It shifts. And sometimes—like tonight—it flickers as if responding to something I can't see.

I lean against the railing and let my eyes adjust to the darkness beyond the boardwalk lights. The tide-pool's surface is calm, mirror-smooth, reflecting the crescent moon overhead. For a moment, everything is still.

Then I see them.

Footprints.

Not on the boardwalk—on the wet stones at the tide-pool's edge, where the water has receded. They're fresh, glistening in the moonlight, and they're *large*. Bigger than any human foot I've ever seen, with strange impressions that don't quite make sense. Not webbed, exactly, but elongated, the toes splayed wide like something built for gripping rock.

My pulse kicks up. I glance around, but the boardwalk is empty. No one else out here. Just me and the sea and whatever made those prints.

I should go back inside. Lock the door, finish closing, go home to my apartment above the diner and pretend I didn't see anything. That's the smart move. The safe move.

Instead, I sling the towel over my shoulder and climb down.

There's a set of stairs cut into the rock outcrop, slick with seaweed and salt. I've been down them a handful of times, usually to retrieve something a tourist dropped or to check the tide-pool's edge after a storm. But never this late. Never alone.

The steps are steep, and I have to brace one hand against the rock wall to keep my balance. The sound of the waves grows louder as I descend, a rhythmic *shush-shush* that drowns out everything else. By the time I reach the bottom, my heart is pounding—not from exertion, but from the sudden, undeniable sense that I'm not alone.

I step onto the wet stones, my boots squelching softly. The footprints are even clearer from here, each one pressed deep into the algae-slick surface. I crouch down, running my fingers along the edge of one. The impression is cool to the touch, still damp, as if whatever made it was here only minutes ago.

"What are you?" I murmur, more to myself than anything.

The tide-pool doesn't answer. But the glow beneath the surface brightens, just for a second, and I swear I see something move. A shadow. A ripple. Something large, shifting beneath the water.

I freeze.

The rational part of my brain is screaming at me to back away, to climb those stairs and get the hell out of here. But another part—the part that moved to Starlight Cove looking for *something*, even if I didn't know what—keeps me rooted in place.

"Hello?" My voice comes out quieter than I intended, barely audible over the waves.

The water stills.

And then, slowly, something rises.

Not out of the water—not yet. But I see the shape of it, just beneath the surface. Long. Sinuous. Arms, maybe, though there are too many of them, and they move with a fluidity that doesn't match anything I've ever seen. The glow intensifies, tracing along the edges of those arms, illuminating what looks like rows of faint circular marks. Suckers, I realize. Like an octopus.

But bigger. So much bigger.

My breath catches in my throat. I should run. I should—

One of the arms breaks the surface.

Just for a moment. Just long enough for me to see the way the moonlight catches on slick skin, the way the bioluminescent glow pulses softly along its length. It reaches—not toward me, but toward the rock I'm crouched beside, as if testing, exploring.

Then it sinks back beneath the water, and the glow fades.

I don't move. Can't move. My mind is racing, trying to reconcile what I just saw with everything I thought I knew about this place. The tide-pool is deep, sure, but not *that* deep. There's no way something that size could live here unnoticed. Unless—

Unless it doesn't want to be noticed.

The thought sends a shiver down my spine, but it's not entirely fear. There's something else there. Curiosity. Wonder. The same feeling I had when I first saw this place and thought, *Yes. This is where I'm supposed to be.*

"Elliot!"

I jolt upright, nearly losing my footing on the slick rock. Marcus is standing at the top of the stairs, silhouetted against the boardwalk lights.

"What the hell are you doing down there?" he calls.

"I—" I glance back at the tide-pool, but the surface is calm again. No movement. No glow. Just dark water and the reflection of the moon. "I thought I saw something."

"Yeah, well, you're gonna see the inside of a hospital if you slip on those rocks. Come on, man. It's late."

I climb back up, my legs shaky, my mind still reeling. Marcus is waiting at the top, arms crossed, looking equal parts annoyed and concerned.

"Forgot my keys," he says, holding up a ring with a ridiculous number of keychains attached. "Saw the lights still on and figured you were doing your whole brooding-ocean-gazing thing again."

"I wasn't brooding."

"Sure." He grins, but it fades when he gets a better look at me. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"I'm fine." The lie comes easily, but my hands are still trembling. I shove them in my pockets. "Just... tired."

Marcus studies me for a beat longer, then shrugs. "All right. Lock up and get some sleep, yeah? You've been running yourself ragged."

"Yeah. I will."

He claps me on the shoulder and heads off, his footsteps echoing on the boardwalk until they fade into the night. I watch him go, then turn back to the tide-pool.

It's dark now. Quiet. But I can still feel it—that presence beneath the surface. Watching. Waiting.

I should be terrified. I should call someone, report it, do *something*.

Instead, I pull the towel tighter around my shoulders and walk back to the diner. My hands are steadier now, but my pulse is still racing, and I can't shake the image of those arms, that glow, the way the water seemed to breathe.

I lock the door behind me, flip off the Edison bulbs, and stand in the darkness of my diner. Through the window, the tide-pool glimmers faintly, a soft green-blue against the black expanse of the ocean beyond.

I moved here for peace. For quiet. For a fresh start.

But tonight, something watches from the water.

And I can't stop thinking about what it might be.

My breath catches in my throat as the tide-pool surface pulses—and then the glow vanishes, leaving only darkness and the echo of something watching.
