## Chapter 1 – “Late-Night Shift”

The last coffee cup clinks onto the tray just as the boardwalk lights flicker and the tide-pool outside the window shivers green-blue.

The sound is a quiet punctuation mark at the end of a long day. 11:43 PM. The wall clock, a vintage piece shaped like a ship’s wheel, ticks with a steady, reassuring rhythm that has become the backbeat to my new life. Another shift done.

“That’s the last of ‘em, boss,” Leo says, wiping his hands on an already-stained towel. His blond hair is sticking up in sweaty spikes, and there’s a smudge of flour on his cheek, but he’s smiling. He’s always smiling. “Old Man Hemlock nursed that last coffee for a solid hour. Think he was trying to set a new land-speed record for slow.”

I manage a tired grin back. “He earned it. He was our only customer after ten.”

The lone late-night patron, Mr. Hemlock, gives a final, slow nod from the door before shuffling out into the cool night, his cane tapping a gentle retreat on the wooden boardwalk. The little bell above the door jingles, a cheerful sound in the sudden silence. Now it’s just me, Leo, and the hushed sounds of the Starlight Cove Diner winding down. The gurgle of the coffee machine, the hum of the pie fridge, and beyond the large plate-glass windows, the endless, soft crush of waves against the shore.

It’s a world away from the life I left behind. Six months ago, my soundtrack was the screech of subway brakes, the incessant ping of deadlines on a dozen different apps, and the frantic pounding in my own chest as I tried to keep up. I was a graphic designer in a city that never slept, and it was slowly killing me. There’s a faint, silvery scar at my temple, hidden by my hair, from a fall in a studio kitchen after a seventy-two-hour crunch. It’s my reminder.

Here, the only crunch is the sea salt under the heel of my boot.

“Alright, I’m heading out,” Leo says, untying his apron. “You good to lock up?”

“Always.” I hoist the tray of used dishes. “Get some rest. You’re on the breakfast rush tomorrow.”

He groans theatrically. “Don’t remind me. Pancake people are a different breed. Need their syrup fix before the sun is even thinking about getting up.” He claps me on the shoulder, a solid, friendly gesture. “Don’t stay out too long, sea breeze bites tonight.”

With a final wave, he’s gone, the bell jingling its farewell.

The silence that settles is different now. It’s heavier, deeper. It’s the kind of quiet that lets you hear your own thoughts. Mostly, mine are a quiet chorus of gratitude. For this place, for the scent of old coffee and sugar that clings to the air, for the simple, grounding work of wiping down a counter. For the view.

I turn to the front windows, looking past the reflection of the warm, amber-lit diner. The boardwalk is a ribbon of light stretching along the rocky coast. Beyond it, nestled in a natural basin of dark basalt, is the tide-pool. The town calls it the Cove-heart. By day, it’s a tourist curiosity, a shallow collection of water and rocks where kids poke at starfish.

But at night, it’s something else.

It glows. A soft, eerie, beautiful bioluminescence that pulses with the rhythm of the tide. The old-timers say it’s always been like this. Just a quirk of the local algae. But tonight, the glow seems different. Brighter, then dimmer, a slow, aquatic breath. It holds my attention, a silent conversation between my quiet diner and the vast, mysterious ocean.

I work on autopilot, my movements a familiar dance. Wipe the counters until the Formica gleams. Refill the salt and pepper shakers. Stack the clean mugs, their ceramic warmth a comfort against my palms. Each task is an anchor, tying me to this place, to this town I chose from a map because the name sounded like a promise: Starlight Cove.

I’m trying so hard to belong here. To shed the skin of the city-dweller, the transient, the guy who is just passing through. But some nights, like tonight, the quiet feels a little too big, and the feeling creeps back in—that I’m an observer, watching this town’s life from behind a pane of glass.

I finish the last of the chores, flipping the sign on the door to ‘CLOSED’ and locking it behind me. But instead of heading for my small apartment above the bakery next door, I grab a cleaning towel from a hook and step out onto the back deck, which opens directly onto the boardwalk.

The air is a shock. Cool, damp, and thick with the smell of salt and wet stone. It tickles the back of my neck and raises goosebumps on my arms beneath my flannel shirt. The boardwalk lights cast long, dancing shadows, and the sound of the ocean is louder out here, a constant, soothing hush.

I walk to the edge of the wooden planks, my boots thudding softly, and lean against the railing that overlooks the Cove-heart. The tide is low, exposing the dark, seaweed-slicked rocks that form the pool’s perimeter. The green-blue glow is faint now, a whisper of light just under the water’s surface. It’s beautiful. Peaceful.

I moved here for peace—but tonight, something watches. It’s a feeling I can’t shake, a prickle of awareness at the nape of my neck. The same feeling I got just before the boardwalk lights flickered. A sense of being observed not by a person, but by the night itself.

My eyes scan the rocks. Something is out of place.

Down by the edge of the water, on the wet, flat stones that are usually swept clean by the tide, are footprints. My breath hitches. They’re fresh. I can see the displaced water glistening in the shallow depressions.

And they are not human.

My heart gives a sudden, hard thud against my ribs. I straighten up, glancing around the empty boardwalk. Nothing. Just the wind and the waves. Curiosity, sharp and insistent, pulls me down the short set of stairs that leads from the boardwalk to the rocky shore.

I crouch beside the prints, the damp cold of the stone seeping through the knee of my jeans. They are large, much larger than my own boot print. The shape is wrong, too—longer, with a broader spread and an arch that seems impossibly high. There are four distinct toe impressions, not five, and they end in wide, blunt tips, as if whatever made them had no nails. They are deep, pressed into the stone as if by a great weight.

What in the world…?

A shiver runs through me that has nothing to do with the cold. A local prank? Some kid with novelty monster feet? It doesn’t feel like a prank. There’s a sense of purpose to the prints, a path leading from the deepest part of the tide-pool to the edge of the rocks, then stopping. As if something walked out of the water and stood here for a moment before wading back in.

“Mark! You lockin’ up for good or you planning on sleeping out there?”

Leo’s voice, calling from the front of the diner, makes me jump. He’s probably realized he left his keys.

“Just a minute!” I call back, my voice sounding thin in the open air.

I hesitate, my gaze fixed on the strange footprints. The pull to understand is a physical tug, a tightening in my gut. This quiet town, my sanctuary, suddenly has a secret. And it’s right here, at the edge of the water, just feet from my diner’s back door. My attraction to this place, to its quiet rhythms, deepens into something else—a thrill, laced with a fine thread of fear.

I take one last look at the footprints, then at the still, dark water of the tide-pool, before turning and heading back up the stairs.

Back on the boardwalk, I sling the damp towel over my shoulder. Leo has gone, the street empty again. I should go home. I should climb the stairs to my apartment, fall into bed, and chalk it all up to an overactive imagination fueled by late nights and too much coffee.

But I can’t. I’m drawn back to the railing, to the silent water. The feeling of being watched is stronger than ever.

I stand at the edge, the warm amber light of my diner a safe, solid square at my back, the cool, mysterious sea a vast darkness before me. The tide-pool’s glow, which had been faint, suddenly pulses. Once. Twice. A soft, luminous heartbeat.

And then, it dims. A fade-wave of retreating light washes through the water, the green-blue glow pulling back into the center like a dying ember. Bewildered, I lean further over the railing, squinting into the growing darkness.

That’s when it happens.

For a single, heart-stopping beat, a large arm breaks the surface of the water. It’s not skin, not scale, but something in between, shimmering with a faint, internal teal light. It’s sleek and powerful, and along its length, I can just make out a pattern of faint rings that seem to hold their own ghostly luminescence. It reaches, not for me, but as if grasping at the last vestiges of the fading light, before it slides back under the surface with barely a ripple.

Gone. The water is black. The glow is gone.

My breath catches in my throat as the tide-pool surface pulses—and then the glow vanishes, leaving only darkness and the echo of something watching.
